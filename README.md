CineVerse
A responsive movie discovery app showcasing a progressive development workflow. It features robust search, deep genre exploration, detailed movie info, and a watchlist, all powered by the TMDB API. The project starts with semantic HTML, evolving into a state-managed Single Page Application.
Key Features
Multi-Page Structure: A complete blueprint with pages for home, movie discovery, watchlist, user accounts, and settings.

Semantic HTML: Structured with modern HTML5 tags like `<main>`,`<header>`,`<footer>`,`<aside>`,`<section>` and `<nav>` for maximum clarity and accessibility.

Interactive Blueprints: Forms and controls are in place for all key user interactions, including search, login, sign up, profile editing, and sorting.

Dynamic Content Ready: Placeholder sections are built to be ready for dynamic content injection via JavaScript.

Technology Stack
Core Foundation (Completed)
Semantic HTML5: The entire structure is built with a strong focus on meaningful and accessible markup.

Future Implementation (Planned)
CSS3: For styling, layout, and creating a fully responsive user interface using modern techniques like Flexbox and Grid.

Modern JavaScript (ES6+): To handle all user interactions, API communication, and dynamic updates to the page.

Fetch API: For making live requests to the TMDB API to get real-time movie data.

A JavaScript Framework: To potentially refactor the application for efficient state management and component-based architecture.

Project Roadmap
The project is being built in distinct phases:

✅ Phase 1: HTML Blueprint

All page structures and semantic layouts are complete. This forms the foundation of the entire application.

➡️ Phase 2: CSS Styling

The next step is to style the application, focusing on a clean, modern, and responsive user interface.

Phase 3: JavaScript Interactivity

Planned implementation of API calls to fetch live data and dynamic DOM manipulation to bring the site to life.

Phase 4: Modernization

Potential refactor of the application into a modern JavaScript framework to create a more efficient Single-Page Application (SPA).
